## 2026-10-24 00:40 PT — M0–M4, chat SLA, traffic-aware planning
Done: M0–M4 on main (probe, grid + meter, workloads + calibration, CP-SAT dispatcher, executor + API; slot
boundaries verified both ways). Chat on qwen3:4b-instruct, streamed, SLA TTFT p95 <= 1.0 s from a sweep.
Chat watts planned from measured traffic; drift re-solve live. ERCOT solve verified. PR 1 (dashboard) merged.
Next: wire machine 4's agent and machine 3's receipts as their PRs land; re-run `make calibrate` on the
instruct model; ERCOT live slot with the meter.
Blockers / needs: PRs from machines 3 and 4.

## 2026-10-24 00:50 PT — multi-laptop guardrails
Done: per-person status files, lane-guard hook, CI (tests + fabricated-data scan + ownership by branch;
first run green), CLAUDE.md lessons, README setup/account/model/worktree rules, branch protection on main
(PR + green `check` for everyone but admin), demo-stable-1 tagged on the live-verified M4 commit (20a41f7).
Next: review/merge PRs from 3 and 4 as they open; wire agent + receipts routes; `make calibrate` on
qwen3:4b-instruct; live `make demo` on current main, then `make tag-stable`.
Blockers / needs: PRs from machines 3 and 4.
