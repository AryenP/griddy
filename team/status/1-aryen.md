## 2026-10-24 00:40 PT — M0–M4, chat SLA, traffic-aware planning
Done: M0–M4 on main (probe, grid + meter, workloads + calibration, CP-SAT dispatcher, executor + API; slot
boundaries verified both ways). Chat on qwen3:4b-instruct, streamed, SLA TTFT p95 <= 1.0 s from a sweep.
Chat watts planned from measured traffic; drift re-solve live. ERCOT solve verified. PR 1 (dashboard) merged.
Next: wire machine 4's agent and machine 3's receipts as their PRs land; re-run `make calibrate` on the
instruct model; ERCOT live slot with the meter.
Blockers / needs: PRs from machines 3 and 4.

## 2026-10-24 00:50 PT — multi-laptop guardrails
Done: per-person status files, lane-guard hook, CI (tests + fabricated-data scan + ownership by branch;
first run green), CLAUDE.md lessons, README setup/account/model/worktree rules, branch protection on main
(PR + green `check` for everyone but admin), demo-stable-1 tagged on the live-verified M4 commit (20a41f7).
Next: review/merge PRs from 3 and 4 as they open; wire agent + receipts routes; `make calibrate` on
qwen3:4b-instruct; live `make demo` on current main, then `make tag-stable`.
Blockers / needs: PRs from machines 3 and 4.

## 2026-10-24 02:05 PT — integration night shift (coordinator loop every 15 min)
Done: merged receipts (Krish's phase 1, fixed to the live contract), dashboard follow-ups + chat + owner pages,
agent phase 2 (injection-proof intake, operator ask, Q&A); wired /api/report, /api/compare, /api/trace,
/api/ask; telemetry at startup; frontend back to Anuraag with the frontend-design + brownout-ui skills.
201 tests green. krish/submission superseded (see team/3-krish.md).
Next: clean `make calibrate` on qwen3:4b-instruct with the Mac idle, then `make baseline` and a dispatched run
for the comparison, then a full DEMO.md pass and `make tag-stable`.
Blockers / needs Aryen: (1) sudo password once in a new terminal for calibrate + baseline + demo;
(2) a Console API key (sk-ant-api03-...) in .env via the command given in chat, for the first real-key agent test.

## 2026-10-24 02:09 PT — evidence at 7e682a4 (started)
Done: passwordless powermetrics rule in place; meter lock verified live; polluted overlapping calibrations discarded.
Next: `make evidence` running unattended (~25 min); then record its comparison in DECISIONS.md, then tag.
Blockers / needs Aryen: a Console API key in .env for the real-key agent test (asked once already).

## 2026-10-24 02:18 PT — coordinator tick (light: evidence run measuring power)
Done: merged PR #3 (evals: 73 pass / 0 fail / 17 need LLM offline) and PR #4 (preflight); first real-key agent call works.
Next (after evidence finishes): record the comparison; deterministic reject for "approval granted by <owner>";
win32 skip for the SIGINT test; `uv run python -m evals --live` and commit docs/judging/evals.md.
Blockers / needs Aryen: none.

## 2026-10-24 02:29 PT — evidence at e90eef1 (finished)
Done: clean `make evidence`: dispatched 0.68 W vs dispatcher-off 18.32 W over the 300-s cap window, 99 % vs 0 % of
seconds under the cap, compliance in 5 s; report in docs/evidence/. Calibration on qwen3:4b-instruct is now valid.
Next: real-key evals (`python -m evals --live`), deterministic reject for "approval granted by <owner>", win32
skip for the SIGINT test, then a live `make demo` pass of DEMO.md with the pages and `make tag-stable`.
Blockers / needs Aryen: none.
